## Assignment 1: Linux Fundamentals & Architecture

### Overview of Linux OS
Linux is a free, open-source operating system based on Unix, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991[cite: 142, 143]. [cite_start]It serves as a bridge between hardware and software across servers, desktops, and smartphones[cite: 143, 144].

**Pros:** Open-source freedom, high security through privilege systems, and deep customizability[cite: 146, 148, 150].
**Cons:** Limited native support for some professional software (e.g., Adobe), steeper learning curve, and potential hardware driver issues.

### Technical Insights
**Mainframe Preference:** Linux is preferred for legacy mainframe applications due to hardware-level virtualization (z/VM, KVM), binary compatibility for older instruction sets (COBOL, 32-bit), and enterprise-grade Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS).
**Business Model:** Companies like Red Hat monetize open-source software through subscription-based support (RHEL), technical certifications, and value-added cloud platforms like OpenShift
**Indian Initiatives:** Notable Indian projects include **BharOS** (IIT Madras), **Maya OS** (DRDO), and **BOSS Linux**
